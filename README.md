This is a batch file / shell script to modify your Pack Install of the Crystal Poptracker Pack by palex00 with different aesthetic choices.
Currently, only alternatives for Badge Images are supported. More will be supported in the future. Please leave your suggestions in the Discord thread.

## Automatic Installation
**WINDOWS:** Just run the ``Crystal Poptracker Pack Adjuster.bat``

**LINUX & MACOS:** Run the ``Crystal_Poptracker_Pack_Adjuster-LINUX-macOS.sh`` shell script. wget is needed for this to work. It will allow you to install it through the shell script itself if it can, otherwise you'll have to install it manually

Thank you to [@tioui](https://github.com/tioui) for fixing the Linux & macOS integration!

Once you have changed the aesthetic to your liking, please delete the script. If you ever want to change your aesthetic choices, re-download it anew as it will be updated and cannot auto-update.

## Manual Installation
Grab the raw files from inside the folders of the ``user-overrides`` branch and place them in the following file path:
  - Windows: ``C:\Users\USER\PopTracker\user-override\ap_crystal_palex00\images\items``
  - Linux & macOS: ``$HOME/PopTracker/user-override\ap_crystal_palex00\images\items``

To delete the override, just delete the ``ap_crystal_palex00`` folder.
